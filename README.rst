This project provides a best-practices template Python project which integrates several different tools. It saves you work by setting up a number of things, including documentation, code checking, and unit test runners.

As it is an all-in-one solution, the tools used are rather opinionated. They include:

* Paver_ for running miscellaneous tasks
* Setuptools_ for distribution (Setuptools and Distribute_ have merged_)
* Sphinx_ for documentation
* flake8_ for source code checking
* pytest_ for unit testing
* mock_ for mocking (not required by the template, but included anyway)
* tox_ for testing on multiple Python versions

Project Setup
=============

This will be the ``README`` for your project. For now, follow these instructions to get this project template set up correctly. Then, come back and replace the contents of this ``README`` with contents specific to your project.
